    "In this lab, we will use a supervised learning approach to solve the link prediction problem. The main idea is that instead of using a single measure to rank the missing links, we use node and link features to output a probability that the link would be added in the future. To do this, we need to\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a training set that contains positive samples (y = 1, a propotion of links that are missing but should be added) and negative samples (y = 0, the links that were never added).  \n",
    "- Create features from the network. Each link is an observation, the features can be node features (e.g. centrality) from both end of the link or the node similarity measures we demonstrated.   \n",
    "- Train statistical models.  \n",
    "- Create the same features on the test set and apply the trained model.\n",
    "- Assess the accuracy.\n",

    "*Important Note*: In this graph, the node (vertex) names are numbers. But it is important to keep them as characters (strings) throughout the lab so igraph functions do not confuse names (characters) with ids (integers). For example, `degree(g, '45')` gives the degree of node whose name is `\"45\"`, whereas `degree(g, 45)` gives the degree of node whose id is `45`. The former is what we want. Therefore. if an edge list is a dataframe, make sure the variable types are characters (chr). You can check the variable types of a df using `glimpse(df)`."
